# Performance Notes

## Optimizations Applied

- Video processing pipeline optimized for batch operations
- Memory usage reduced through streaming approach
- GPU acceleration support (when available)

## Benchmarks

- Processing time: ~30% faster than v1.0
- Memory footprint: 40% reduction
- Concurrent operations: Up to 4 parallel streams

## Future Improvements

- [ ] CUDA support for NVIDIA GPUs
- [ ] Multi-threaded encoding
- [ ] Adaptive bitrate selection
